## 🚀 What is this?

This project is a **browser-based GeoJSON → FlatGeobuf converter**.

It allows you to upload a GeoJSON file and convert it into the highly efficient FlatGeobuf binary format — without any backend or server-side processing.

---

## 🌐 100% Browser-Based

All processing happens entirely in the **browser**:

- No server required  
- No file uploads to external services  
- Fully offline-capable once loaded  

Your geospatial data never leaves your machine.

---

## 🧵 Web Workers Powered

To ensure smooth performance and a non-blocking UI, the heavy processing is executed inside **Web Workers**.

This means:

- The UI stays responsive during large file conversions  
- GeoJSON parsing and encoding run in a separate thread  
- Better performance for large datasets  
- No freezing or blocking of the main thread  

---

## 🦀 Powered by Rust + WebAssembly

This tool is built on top of the official **FlatGeobuf Rust implementation** and compiled to WebAssembly.

Original library:
https://github.com/flatgeobuf/flatgeobuf :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

The Rust core handles:
- Fast GeoJSON parsing
- Efficient FlatGeobuf encoding
- Spatial indexing (R-tree)
- Binary serialization

It is compiled to WASM to run directly inside the browser at near-native performance.

## 💡 Notes

FlatGeobuf is a high-performance binary format designed for fast reading, streaming, and spatial indexing of geospatial vector data.

It is significantly more efficient than traditional formats like GeoJSON for large datasets.
